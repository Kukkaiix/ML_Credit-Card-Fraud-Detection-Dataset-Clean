# Credit Card Fraud Data Quality Pipeline & EDA

This project implements a professional-grade data quality assessment, validation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline for credit card fraud detection datasets.
The pipeline is designed following industry best practices used in financial risk analytics and data engineering workflows.

The objective is not immediate data mutation, but to provide a transparent, auditable diagnosis of data quality before any cleaning, feature engineering, or modeling decisions are made.
